 <h1>Welcome To IT'S YUMMY!</h1>
 <p>Our primary focus is to provide you with easy, everyday recipes and cooking tips to home cooks of all experience levels.</p>
 <p>IT’S YUMMY has over 10 years of experience between our professional  chefs and is currently operated by MaeLou Media. Maelou Media has established themselves as a leader in food blogs after over 8 years of experience in the industry.

    This is comfort food heaven mixed in with everyday easy recipes. This is the ultimate place where you will find some of the most delicious and easy recipes for your family.
    
    We focus on primarily cooking from scratch, but are huge believers in saving time (and $$$$) whenever possible. We’ll use short cut recipes and convenience products from time to time to help you save time on those crazy busy days that we all have!
    
    Here at It’s Yummi we believe that everyone deserves to eat nutritiously balanced meals, even those on a tight budget. We provide nutritious recipes with a budget in mind, and the occasional sweet treats and desserts, because a little indulgence is a good thing!
    
    Many of our recipes use fresh, unprocessed ingredients, with organics appearing when it’s cost-effective, or when I have evidence that it’s really important. And you can be sure that I’ll share that evidence with you!
    
    Thank you so much for being here!</p>
